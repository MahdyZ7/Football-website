# Suggested Rules for Better Game Management

This document contains suggested additional rules that could improve game management, player accountability, and overall game flow. These are recommendations to complement the existing rules in `Rules.md`.

## 1. Pre-Game Preparation

- **Equipment Check**: All players must have appropriate footwear (no metal studs if on artificial turf) and shin guards.
- **Weather Cancellation Policy**: Clear criteria for when games are cancelled (e.g., heavy rain, lightning, extreme heat).
- **Pre-game Captain's Meeting**: 2 minutes before kickoff, team captains meet with referee to confirm teams and any special conditions.
- **Warm-up Time**: Designated 10-minute warm-up period before first game starts.

## 2. Game Flow Management

- **Substitution Windows**: Substitutions only allowed during:
  - Goal kicks
  - After a goal is scored
  - Injury stoppages
  - Half-time (if 10-minute games have a brief 1-minute half-time)
- **Time-wasting Prevention**: Referee can add extra time for excessive delays (goal celebrations, arguments, slow restarts).
- **Quick Restart Rule**: Ball must be in play within 5 seconds of a free kick, corner, or throw-in.
- **Maximum 3 Substitutions Per Team**: Prevents constant rotation that disrupts game flow.

## 3. Conflict Resolution

### Yellow/Red Card System
- **Yellow card** = 2-minute sin bin (player off the pitch)
- **Second yellow** = Red card (player out for remainder of game)
- **Straight red** = player banned from next game

### Dispute Resolution Protocol
- Only **team captain** can speak to referee
- Maximum **30 seconds** for discussion
- Excessive arguing = yellow card for dissent

### Cool-down Period
- After heated moments, referee can call 30-second timeout for teams to regroup

## 4. Player Accountability

- **Registration Deadline**: Players must register by a specific day/time before game day (e.g., Saturday 6 PM for Sunday game).
- **Late Cancellation Fee**: Players who cancel within 24 hours contribute to group fund (unless emergency).
- **Strike System**:
  - 3 strikes (late/no-show) in a season = automatic 1-month ban
  - Resets every 3 months for good behavior
- **Injury Reporting**: Players must report injuries immediately to avoid confusion about availability.

## 5. Team Balance & Fairness

- **Skill Rating System**: Players rated 1-5 by organizers, teams balanced by total skill points.
- **Goalkeeper Rotation**: If using designated goalkeepers, they rotate teams every 2 games to ensure fairness.
- **Mercy Rule**: If one team leads by 5+ goals, game ends early and teams are rebalanced.
- **Star Player Distribution**: Top-rated players distributed evenly across teams during selection.

## 6. Safety & Welfare

- **Injury Assessment**: If player injured, 30-second assessment period. If cannot continue, substitute immediately.
- **Hydration Breaks**: In hot weather (>28°C/82°F), mandatory 1-minute water break at halfway point.
- **Dangerous Play**: Slide tackles from behind = automatic yellow card.
- **Goalkeeper Safety**: No charging the goalkeeper while they have possession.

## 7. Game Administration

- **Score Tracking**: Designated scorekeeper (non-playing member or waiting team member) to avoid disputes.
- **Match Statistics**: Optional: track goals, assists, clean sheets for fun rankings.
- **Equipment Manager**: One person responsible for bibs, balls, first aid kit each week.
- **Post-Game Debrief**: Quick 2-minute team huddle after games for feedback and improvements.

## 8. Communication & Scheduling

- **24-Hour Reminder**: Automated reminder sent 24 hours before game time.
- **Weather Updates**: Updates posted 2 hours before game time if conditions are questionable.
- **Team Announcement**: Teams announced 30 minutes before kickoff on the website/app.
- **Emergency Contact**: All players provide emergency contact number for serious injuries.

## 9. Financial & Resource Management

- **Payment Deadline**: Players must pay by registration deadline or spot given to waitlist.
- **No-Show Penalty**: Forfeits payment for that week (covers pitch rental).
- **Equipment Replacement**: Players who damage equipment (e.g., puncture ball) responsible for replacement.
- **Group Fund**: All late fees and penalties go into group fund for social events or equipment.

## 10. Sportsmanship Recognition

- **Fair Play Award**: Monthly recognition for most sporting player (voted by peers).
- **Goal of the Week**: Community votes on best goal (posted on social media/website).
- **Referee Recognition**: Publicly thank referees each week for their service.
- **Positive Culture**: Encourage applauding good play from both teams.
